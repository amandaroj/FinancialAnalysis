# Financial Performance Analysis



## Situation

At a leading consulting firm, the finance team is facing a complex challenge: the company lacks a centralised view of the financial perfomance and financial models are created at a country level without being aggregated. This lack of clarity obscured the true financial health and performance across different services and regions, making it difficult to:

- Understand the revenue distribution and profitability by country and service line.
- Assess the financial impact of the firm's diverse service offerings.
- Identify the efficiency of cost management strategies within various components of EBITDA.
- Determine the effectiveness of current financial strategies in achieving long-term profitability and growth.
- Analyze the potential for market expansion and service optimization based on clear financial indicators.
- Evaluate the conversion of financial data into strategic business actions and decision-making.
## Task

As the data analyst for the consulting firm, my task was to dissect and translate the financial models coming from different country teams into a coherent, interactive Excel dashboard. The challenge was to uncover hidden patterns, provide a granular view of financial performance, and empower the finance team with actionable insights to drive revenue growth and cost efficiency.
## Action


I created a thorough analysis in Excel that synthesizes financial data into an interactive dashboard using advanced features like VLOOKUPS, INDEX, MATCH, Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, and slicers. The interactive visualizations revealed:

- 10-year revenue and EBITDA trends for a long-term financial perspective.
- Service profitability analysis for offerings like Accounting, Artificial Intelligence, and Marketing.
- Detailed EBITDA breakdown for insights into revenue, COGS, gross profit, overheads, and cost control.

## Result

The deployed dashboard provided valuable insights for the business, highlighting areas for improvement that the finance team can act on.

The finance team's forecasting dashboard reveals a concerning outlook for 2024, indicating potential financial challenges for the consulting firm. A comparison between 2023 and 2024 shows a significant drop in revenue for the Marketing service line, decreasing from nearly $260,000 in 2023 to $200,000 in 2024. This decline is accompanied by increased costs in COGS and overhead expenses for 2024.

These issues in the Marketing service area may be due to reduced market demand, heightened competition, or ineffective marketing strategies. The rising expenses despite falling revenue could strain profit margins.

With this forecast in mind, the finance team can take proactive steps to revamp the Marketing service's financial strategy. Implementing corrective measures could potentially recover up to $100,000 in revenue for 2024, aligning the service line's performance with the firm's financial goals.
## Next Steps

- Add a country filter and compare Service Profitability and EBITDA bridge by country
- Identify the years, services or countries (or a combination of these) where margins are optimised so that we can advise the leaders to replicate those optimal conditions
